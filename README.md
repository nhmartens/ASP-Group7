# ASP-Group7
Group Assignment - Final Report
All the raw data used for the Analysis is uploaded to this Git, the Code for the analysis is Data_Analysis_Group7.R
In order to run the code the directories of the Data and Program folders need to be adjusted and the raw data downloaded and moved to the Data folder.

As some of the data cleaning steps might not be replicable in every setup of R, we also provide intermediary datasets that result from the data cleaning. The final dataset used for the regression models is called df_country1. This can also be read-in manually to replicate the regression results.
